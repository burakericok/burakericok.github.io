### Optical characterization of nano-structures
Characterization of nanometer sized structures has gained interested in various fields from nano-manufacturing to combustion systems. Recent research has been focused on non-destructive, fast and reliable techniques over conventional microscope based methods. With this regard, this project focuses on identifying the size and geometric configuration of nano-particle aggregates using numerical light scattering experiments. We have shown that the problem can be formulated as an inverse problem and solved by deterministic methods and probabilistic Bayesian statistical methods. Recently, we have introduced Gaussian processes, a supervised machine learning technique, to model more complex and complicated systems.   

### Phase transitions and glass transitions
Important phenomena, not yet fully understood. One of the unsolved problems in condensed matter physics. hard disk systems exhibiting these transitions. methods from topologicl data analysis to understand the topology of the configuration space.
